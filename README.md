# Iris Flowers ML Project

One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on Machine Learning projects for students is working on Iris Flowers classification ML project. Iris flowers dataset is one of the best datasets for classification tasks. Since iris flowers are of varied species, they can be distinguished based on the length of sepals and petals. This ML project aims to classify the flowers into among the three species – Virginica, Setosa, or Versicolor.

This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities. And this is the perfect idea for your next machine learning project!
